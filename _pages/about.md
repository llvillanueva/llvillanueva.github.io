Mabuhay! I am Lloydie from the Philippines.
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<p>I am a <strong>Mathematical Physicist</strong> turned <strong>Data Scientist</strong>, and currently exploring the interdisplinary field of <strong>Earth System Science</strong>. 


<p>I earned my B.Sc. Physics degree as a <a href='https://sei.dost.gov.ph/index.php/programs-and-projects/scholarships/undergraduate-scholarships#s-t-undergraduate-scholarships'>DOST RA 7687 Scholar</a> from <a href='http://nip.upd.edu.ph/'>National Institute of physics</a> at the <a href = 'https://upd.edu.ph/'>University of the Philipines, Diliman</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href='http://nip.upd.edu.ph/profiles/eric-a-galapon/'>Eric Galapon</a> in his <a href= 'https://quant-math.org/wp/'>QuantMath Subgroup</a>. I continue working with Prof. Galapon through my M. Sc. Physics degree while being employed as instructor at the same institution. His passion towards understanding quantum systems led him to develop his so-called <strong>finite-part integration</strong>, which is the focus of my research for my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degree. In our <a href='https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jmp/article-abstract/62/4/043505/235708/Finite-part-integration-in-the-presence-of'>published paper</a>, we elaborated the method of finite-part integration and extended its applicability. 

<p>This year, I decided to leave the academe and started working as a data scientist at the <a href='https://www.securitybank.com/'>Security Bank</a> in the Philippines. Using supervised machine learning, I made a churn model of deposit customers for bank retention program and a propensity model of credit card customers for the bank cross-selling initiative. Life indeed unpredictable, my passion in science brings me here in Trieste, Italy to finally realized my childhood dreams. 

<p>Currently, I am a postgraduate diploma student here at <a href='https://www.ictp.it/'>The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics</a> for a year and I will be taught and mentored by <a href='https://www.ictp.it/esp'>notable scientist of Earth System Physics</a>. 

<p>Besides research, I enjoy freedivingü§ø, watching filmüçø, and photographyüì∑. So if I'm not in the school or laboratory, I'll be just in the ocean freediving, in my room or cinema watching movies, and walking around talking photos of what I want you to see. 

<p>Here, have a look at my <a href='/cv/'>cv</a>.
