Mabuhay! I am Lloydie from the Philippines.
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
  <p>I am a <strong>PhD student</strong> at <a href='https://www.chalmers.se/en/'>Chalmers University of Technology</a>, under the supervision of Professor <a href='https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/ickes/'>Luisa Ickes</a>. The goal of my research is to improve the representation of Arctic clouds in climate models.</p>

  <p>Through the <a href='https://www.ictp.it/opportunity/ictp-postgraduate-diploma-programme'>postgraduate diploma programme</a> (a highly recommended program!!!) at <a href='https://www.ictp.it/'>The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics</a>, I was introduced to the field of atmospheric science and trained by <a href='https://www.ictp.it/esp'>notable scientists of Earth System Physics</a>. I was fortunate to work with Professor <a href='https://users.ictp.it/~tompkins/'>Adrian Tompkins</a>, where we characterized cold pools formed over land and ocean using weather station data, specifically the <a href='https://www.arm.gov/capabilities/observatories/twp'>ARM ‚Äì Tropical Western Pacific</a> dataset.</p>

  <p>Before diving into this field, I was trained in Mathematical Physics under the supervision of Professor <a href='http://nip.upd.edu.ph/profiles/eric-a-galapon/'>Eric Galapon</a> in his <a href='https://quant-math.org/wp/'>QuantMath Subgroup</a>, where we <a href='https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jmp/article-abstract/62/4/043505/235708/Finite-part-integration-in-the-presence-of'>elaborated on the method of finite-part integration and extended its applicability</a>.</p>

  <p>Besides research, I enjoy freediving ü§ø, watching films üçø, and photography üì∑. So if I'm not in school or the lab, I'm probably in the ocean freediving, in my room or at the cinema watching movies, or out walking around taking photos of what I want you to see.</p>

  <p>If you're more interested in my detailed experience, have a look at my <a href='/cv/'>CV</a>.</p>
